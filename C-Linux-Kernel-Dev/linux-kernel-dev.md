# Linux Kernel Development

This document is meant to supplement our [compilation
guide](https://cs4118.github.io/dev-guides/debian-kernel-compilation.html),
which goes over how to install a new kernel on your machine.

## Kernel Module Makefile

More info in our [kernel module
guide](https://cs4118.github.io/dev-guides/linux-modules.html), but for the sake
of comparison, here it is again:

```make
obj-m += hello.o
all:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) modules
clean:
    make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=$(PWD) clean
```

This Makefile is separate from the top-level kernel source Makefile we're about
to work with. Here, we're adding to the `obj-m` "goal definition" (build object
as module) and using a specialized Makefile located at `/lib/modules/$(shell
uname -r)/build` to link our module into the kernel.

## Top-level Kernel Makefile

`linux/Makefile` is the only Makefile you'll be executing when developing with
the kernel. At a high level, this Makefile is responsible for:

- recursively calling Makefiles in subdirectories
- generating kernel configurations
- building and installing kernel images

Here's an overview of the common operations you'll be doing with this Makefile.

### Preparing for development

It's good practice to ensure you have a clean kernel source before beginning to
development. Here's the cleaning options that this Makefile provides, as
reported by `make help`:

```
Cleaning targets:
  clean       - Remove most generated files but keep the config and
                enough build support to build external modules
  mrproper    - Remove all generated files + config + various backup files
  distclean.  - mrproper + remove editor backup and patch files
```

`make mrproper` is usually sufficient for our purposes. Be warned that you'll
have to completely rebuild the kernel after running this!

### Configuration and compilation

`linux/.config` is the kernel's configuration file. It lists a bunch of options
that determine the properties of the kernel you're about to build. It also
determines what code will be compiled and linked into the final kernel image.
For example, if `CONFIG_SMP` is set, you're letting the kernel know that you
have more than one processor so it can provide multi-processing functionality.

There's a bunch of different ways to generate this configuration file. Here's
the relevant options we have, as reported by `make help` in the top-level kernel
directory:

```
Configuration targets:
  config          - Update current config utilising a line-oriented program
  menuconfig      - Update current config utilising a menu based program
  oldconfig       - Update current config utilising a provided .config as base
  localmodconfig  - Update current config disabling modules not loaded
  defconfig       - New config with default from ARCH supplied defconfig
  olddefconfig	  - Same as oldconfig but sets new symbols to their
                    default value without prompting
```

Summarizing from our [compilation
guide](https://cs4118.github.io/dev-guides/debian-kernel-compilation.html), we
set up our kernel config in a couple of steps:

```
make olddefconfig # Use current kernel's .config + ARCH defaults
make menuconfig   # Manually edit some configs
```

If you want to **significantly** reduce your build time, you can also set your
config to skip unloaded modules during compilation:

```sh
yes '' | make localmodconfig
```

As you're developing in the kernel, you might add additional source files that
need to be compiled and linked in. Open up the directory's Makefile and add your
desired object file to the `obj-y` goal definition, which is for "built-in"
functionality (as opposed to kernel modules). For example, here's the relevant
portion of `linux/kernel/Makefile`:

```make
obj-y     = fork.o exec_domain.o panic.o \
	    cpu.o exit.o softirq.o resource.o \
	    sysctl.o sysctl_binary.o capability.o ptrace.o user.o \
	    signal.o sys.o umh.o workqueue.o pid.o task_work.o \
	    extable.o params.o \
	    kthread.o sys_ni.o nsproxy.o \
	    notifier.o ksysfs.o cred.o reboot.o \
	    async.o range.o smpboot.o ucount.o
```

If you were adding a source file to `linux/kernel`, you'd add the object file
target here.

Once you're ready to compile your kernel, you run the following in the top-level
source directory:

```sh
make -j $(nproc)
```

This will compile your kernel across all available CPUs, as reported by `nproc`.
Note that this top-level Makefile will recursively build source code in
subdirectories for you!

### Kernel installation

Like in our [compilation
guide](https://cs4118.github.io/dev-guides/debian-kernel-compilation.html), you
run the following command once the compilation finishes:

```sh
sudo make modules_install && sudo make install
```

The first time you install a kernel, you must build `modules_install`. All
subsequent times, `install` is sufficient.

Finally, reboot and select the kernel version you just installed via the GRUB
menu!

## Kernel Code Style

The kernel source comes with a linter written in Perl (located at
`linux/scripts/checkpatch.pl`).

checkpatch will let you know about any stylistic errors and warnings that it
finds in the codebase. You should get into the habit of running checkpatch and
fixing what it suggests before major checkpoints.

If you want a general overview of kernel code style, here's
[one](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v5.10/process/coding-style.html). You can
also find this in `linux/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst`.

## Debugging Techniques

- Take
  [snapshots](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Fusion/12/com.vmware.fusion.using.doc/GUID-4C90933D-A31F-4A56-B5CA-58D3AE6E93CF.html)
  of your VM before installing software that may corrupt it.
- Use `printk/pr_info` to log messages to the kernel log buffer (viewable in
  userspace with by running `sudo dmesg`)
- Set up a [serial port](http://cs4118.github.io/freezer/#tips) to redirect log
  buffer to your host machine (in case VM crashes before you can check it with
  `dmesg`).
